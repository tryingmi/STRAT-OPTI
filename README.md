üöÄ **Automated Trading Strategy Tester for Keltner Channel (KC) and Moving Averages (MA)**

This script is designed to automate the testing of different configurations for a trading strategy using the **Keltner Channel (KC)** and **Moving Averages (MA)** on a trading platform. It systematically tests various combinations of KC lengths, Fast MA, and Slow MA values to find the most profitable configurations. Perfect for traders and developers looking to optimize their strategies!

---

## ‚ú® **Features**

- **Automated Testing**: Automates the process of testing different KC lengths and MA crossover configurations.
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects key performance metrics such as **profit**, **drawdown**, **percent profitable**, and **profit factor**.
- **Results Export**: Saves the test results to a **JSON file** for further analysis.
- **User Interaction Simulation**: Simulates user interactions to set input values and trigger updates in the trading platform UI.
- **Completion Notification**: Plays a sound notification when the testing process is complete.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

The script uses the following configuration constants:

| **Parameter**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `initialFastMARange`   | Range of values for the **Fast MA** (e.g., `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`).          |
| `initialSlowMARange`   | Range of values for the **Slow MA** (e.g., `[20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`). |
| `maTypes`              | Types of Moving Averages to test (e.g., `["SMA"]` for Simple Moving Average).   |
| `kcLengthRange`        | Range of values for the **KC length** (e.g., `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`). |
| `inputBoxIndices`      | Indices for Fast MA and Slow MA input fields in the UI.                         |
| `kcInputIndex`         | Index for the KC input field in the UI.                                         |
| `maxWaitTime`          | Maximum wait time (in milliseconds) for price updates after changing inputs.    |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**

### **Step 1: Setup**
- Ensure that the trading platform UI is open and the necessary elements are accessible.
- Make sure the script has access to the required DOM elements (e.g., input fields, buttons, and profit display).

### **Step 2: Run the Script**
Execute the `startTesting()` function to begin the testing process.

```javascript
// Start the testing process
startTesting();
```

### **Step 3: Review Results**
- The script will save the results to a **JSON file** (e.g., `BTC_SMA_results.json`).
- The top 10 configurations will be displayed in the console for quick review.

---

## üìÇ **Output**

The script generates a **JSON file** containing the test results, sorted by **profit factor**. The file is named according to the coin and MA type (e.g., `BTC_SMA_results.json`).

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "kcLength": 10,
    "fastMA": 5,
    "slowMA": 20,
    "profit": 150.25,
    "drawdown": 5.3,
    "percentProfitable": 60.5,
    "profitFactor": 2.1
  },
  {
    "kcLength": 12,
    "fastMA": 10,
    "slowMA": 30,
    "profit": 140.75,
    "drawdown": 6.1,
    "percentProfitable": 58.7,
    "profitFactor": 1.9
  }
]
```
